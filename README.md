# kafka-stack dashboards

The dashboards branch is used to store Kafka topic dashboards. The dashboards are configured to monitor topics lag and alert to slack channels when it has reached a set threshold or there is no data.

Documentation for configuring dashboards and creating the associated pipelines can be found in Confluence [here](https://companieshouse.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVOPS/pages/4084793345/Kafka+dashboards) .
